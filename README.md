# TemPro
TemPro is an accurate tempo tap detector which works on a simple yet unique algorithm written by myself. TemPro firstly calculates the average difference between each beat played by the user in miliseconds for better accuracy. After that, 60,000 is divided by the average difference to finally get the BPM (beats per minute).
